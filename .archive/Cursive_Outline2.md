# Cursive Language Specification — WASM‑Structured Definition‑Complete Outline (v7)
_Generated on 2025-12-17. Source basis: `Cursive.md`._

## Conventions for This Outline
- Items in this outline describe **required content** for a definition‑complete specification.
- If an item is marked `[TODO: …]`, then the corresponding content was **not detected in the current source draft** and MUST be added (or explicitly specified as absent / not applicable) in the definition‑complete spec.
- “Static Semantics” corresponds to compile-time semantics (well-formedness, typing, and other checks); “Dynamic Semantics” corresponds to run-time semantics (evaluation, effects, and trapping).

## 1. Introduction

This chapter establishes the foundation for reading and implementing this specification. It defines what Cursive is, what this document covers, how to interpret its notation, and what constitutes conforming implementations and programs.

### 1.1 Document Version and Status

This document is version v0.5. It was published on 2025-12-17 and has status Draft.

Later versions supersede earlier versions. Conforming implementations MUST document which version they implement.

### 1.2 Overview

#### 1.2.1 What is Cursive

Informative.

**Cursive** is a statically typed, compiled programming language for systems programming with memory safety, deterministic resource management, and capability-based security. Safe Cursive code is constrained by the type system (§9), permission system (§10), and authority model (§4) to avoid memory-safety violations and data races as classified in §1.10.


#### 1.2.2 Design Goals

Informative.

Cursive is designed around the following core goals:

**Memory Safety Without Runtime Overhead.** Safe Cursive code is statically checked for memory safety via the type system (§9), permission system (§10), and responsibility model (§3.4), without requiring garbage collection or runtime reference counting in the general case.

**Deterministic Resource Management.** Every resource has exactly one responsible binding. Destruction occurs deterministically when the responsible binding goes out of scope, in reverse declaration order (§3.5). There are no hidden allocations or deallocations.

**No Ambient Authority.** Observable external effects require explicit capability parameters as specified in the authority model (§4). Effect requirements are visible at call sites.

**Explicit Over Implicit.** Mutability, side effects, and responsibility transfer are explicitly marked in source code. The `var` keyword indicates mutability, capability parameters indicate potential effects, and the `move` keyword indicates responsibility transfer.

**Local Reasoning.** The permission system ensures that a `unique` reference guarantees exclusive access, and capability parameters make effect requirements visible at call sites.

#### 1.2.3 Concepts

Informative.

Cursive is organized around the following core concepts, each defined normatively in later chapters:

- Program structure: projects, assemblies, modules, and compilation units (§5).
- Object and binding model: storage, bindings, responsibility, and deterministic destruction (§3.1–§3.5).
- Authority model: explicit capabilities and no ambient authority (§4).
- Type system and permissions: nominal/structural types and the permission lattice (§9–§10).
- Key system: synchronized access for shared data (§17).
- Concurrency and async: structured parallelism and asynchronous operations (§18–§19).
- Metaprogramming and interoperability: compile-time execution, FFI, and ABI (§20–§22).

#### 1.2.4 Semantic Overview

Informative.

A Cursive program is processed through four sequential phases:

1. **Parsing.** Source text is transformed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). See §2.9.1.
2. **Compile-Time Execution.** `comptime` blocks are evaluated and may generate additional declarations. See §2.9.2.
3. **Type Checking.** The AST is validated for type correctness, permission safety, and contract satisfaction. See §2.9.3.
4. **Code Generation.** The validated AST is transformed into executable code. See §2.9.4.

### 1.3 Scope

This specification defines requirements for Cursive implementations and for Cursive programs; therefore this document defines the Cursive language.

#### 1.3.1 What This Specification Defines

This specification defines:

- The lexical structure of Cursive source text
- The abstract machine model and memory semantics
- The capability-based authority model
- The module system and name resolution
- The type system, including primitives, compounds, and polymorphism
- Expression and statement semantics
- The key system for synchronized access
- Structured parallelism and asynchronous operations
- Compile-time metaprogramming
- Foreign function interface requirements

#### 1.3.2 What This Specification Excludes

This specification does not define:

- The contents of any standard library beyond foundational classes (Appendix D)
- Runtime system implementation details
- Debugger interfaces or debug information formats
- Build system or package management
- Editor or IDE integration
- Performance characteristics beyond algorithmic complexity where specified

These aspects are defined by separate, complementary documents.

#### 1.3.3 Security Considerations

Informative.

Cursive mitigates memory and authority risks via the responsibility model (§3.4), permission system (§10), and the no-ambient-authority requirement (§4.1.1). Lexical security requirements are defined in §2.8.

The execution environment is responsible for enforcing capability boundaries and resource limits. Providing a capability grants authority to perform its associated effects; withholding a capability prevents those effects. Trust boundaries for `unsafe` code and FFI are defined in §3.7 and §21.

Mitigations for side-channel leakage and for resource-exhaustion beyond the capability model are outside the scope of this specification.

### 1.4 Normative References

The following documents are referred to in this specification in such a way that some or all of their content constitutes requirements of this document.

#### 1.4.1 Reference Policy

If a referenced document is dated, only that edition applies. If a referenced document is undated, the latest edition applies.

In case of conflict between this specification and a referenced document, this specification controls unless it explicitly delegates authority for a topic to the referenced document.

#### 1.4.2 Unicode Standard

**The Unicode Standard, Version 15.0 or later.** The Unicode Consortium.

This specification relies on Unicode for:
- Source text encoding (§2.1)
- Identifier syntax via UAX #31 (§2.5.1)
- Character literals and string encoding (§2.6.3, §2.6.4)
- Normalization Form C (NFC) for identifier comparison (§2.1.3)

#### 1.4.3 IEEE 754-2008

**IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754-2008).** Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

This specification relies on IEEE 754 for:
- Floating-point type semantics (`f16`, `f32`, `f64`) (§11.1.2)
- NaN, infinity, and signed zero behavior
- Rounding modes and exception handling

#### 1.4.4 RFC 2119

**Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels (RFC 2119).** Internet Engineering Task Force.

This specification uses RFC 2119 keywords as defined in §1.7.2.

### 1.5 Document Structure

#### 1.5.1 Organization

This specification is organized into eight parts:

| Part | Title                       | Content                                                                     |
| :--- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I    | General and Lexical         | Introduction, lexical structure, source encoding                            |
| II   | The Abstract Machine        | Memory model, object lifecycle, authority model                             |
| III  | Program Structure           | Modules, scopes, attributes, program lifecycle                              |
| IV   | The Type System             | Type fundamentals, permissions, concrete and behavioral types, polymorphism |
| V    | Executable Semantics        | Procedures, expressions, statements, key system                             |
| VI   | Concurrency                 | Parallel blocks, async operations                                           |
| VII  | Metaprogramming and Interop | Comptime, FFI, ABI                                                          |
| VIII | Appendices                  | Diagnostics, grammar, layout, standard classes                              |

#### 1.5.2 Section Structure

Cursive adopts the same intra-section organization pattern used throughout the WebAssembly Core Specification:

1. **Overview prose (1-3 paragraphs).** The first paragraph defines the concept and its role in the language, using declarative, implementation-independent statements.

2. **Syntax (when applicable).** One or more grammar productions (EBNF) define the construct's abstract shape. Immediately following the grammar, prose explains each alternative or parameter in the order it appears.

3. **Conventions (optional).** A short "Conventions" subsection is used to introduce abbreviations, derived notations, helper functions, or metavariable conventions that are local to the section.

4. **Static Semantics.** Static rules are stated in a declarative "is valid ... if:" style:
   - a lead sentence describing the judgment ("The ... is valid with ... if:"),
   - a bullet list of premises/side conditions (including "Either/Or" structure where needed),
   - and (where useful) a formal inference rule rendering the same constraints.

5. **Dynamic Semantics.** Dynamic rules are stated in a step-wise style:
   - reduction rules for local transitions and traps,
   - short numbered algorithms for multi-step behavior,
   - and explicit "Assert: due to Static Semantics, ..." preconditions when relying on earlier checks.

6. **Notes and diagnostics.** Non-normative commentary is marked as "Note". Required error conditions are tied to diagnostic codes and described as invalidity/traps at the point they arise.

### 1.6 Conformance

#### 1.6.1 Implementation Conformance

A **conforming implementation** is a software system that:

1. Accepts all well-formed programs as defined by this specification.
2. Rejects all ill-formed programs with the required diagnostics.
3. Executes well-formed programs with behavior consistent with the semantics defined herein.
4. Documents all Implementation-Defined Behavior (§1.10.2).
5. Supports at least the minimum implementation limits (§1.9.1).

An implementation MAY provide extensions beyond this specification. Such extensions:
- MUST be documented.
- MUST NOT alter the semantics of conforming programs that do not use the extension.
- SHOULD be syntactically distinguishable from standard Cursive.

#### 1.6.2 Program Conformance

A **conforming program** is a Cursive source program that satisfies all normative requirements of this specification applicable to programs.

A conforming program satisfies:

1. All lexical constraints defined in §2.
2. All syntactic constraints defined in §2.
3. All static-semantic constraints defined throughout this specification.

#### 1.6.3 Well-Formed Programs

A **well-formed program** is a conforming program for which a conforming implementation produces no required diagnostics.

**Diagnostics:** See Appendix A, code `E-CNF-0101`.

#### 1.6.4 Diagnosable Rules and Required Diagnostics

A violation of a static-semantic rule is a diagnosable rule unless it is classified as IFNDR (§1.10.5).

When detecting such a violation is computationally undecidable or infeasible, an implementation is not required to issue a diagnostic.

For diagnosable rules, a conforming implementation MUST issue the required diagnostic at the point of violation as specified by the relevant section.

#### 1.6.5 Abstract Machine and Observable Behavior (Overview)

Informative.

Cursive defines execution via an abstract machine that tracks storage, bindings, permissions, keys, and capabilities, and evaluates program steps as state transitions (§3.6.1). Observable behavior comprises externally detectable effects (capability-mediated I/O, FFI, panic, and `Drop::drop`), and implementations MUST preserve this behavior (§3.6.2–§3.6.3).

### 1.7 Document Conventions and Notation

#### 1.7.1 Normative and Informative Material

Text explicitly labeled “Informative” is non-normative. All unlabeled prose, tables, and formal rules are normative.

If a conflict exists between normative and informative text, normative text controls.

#### 1.7.2 RFC 2119 Keywords

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

| Keyword                     | Meaning                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MUST, REQUIRED, SHALL       | Absolute requirement; violation renders a program ill-formed or an implementation non-conforming |
| MUST NOT, SHALL NOT         | Absolute prohibition                                                                             |
| SHOULD, RECOMMENDED         | There may be valid reasons to ignore, but implications must be understood                        |
| SHOULD NOT, NOT RECOMMENDED | There may be valid reasons when acceptable, but implications must be understood                  |
| MAY, OPTIONAL               | Truly optional; implementations may or may not provide                                           |

#### 1.7.3 Grammar Notation

This specification uses Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) for grammar productions:

| Notation        | Meaning                   |
| :-------------- | :------------------------ |
| `::=`           | Definition                |
| `\|`            | Alternative               |
| `( )`           | Grouping                  |
| `[ ]`           | Optional (zero or one)    |
| `{ }`           | Repetition (zero or more) |
| `+`             | One or more               |
| `*`             | Zero or more              |
| `?`             | Optional (zero or one)    |
| `"text"`        | Literal terminal          |
| `/* comment */` | Prose description         |

Non-terminal names use `snake_case`. Terminal keywords use lowercase. The complete grammar is collected in Appendix B.

#### 1.7.4 Typing Judgment Notation

Typing rules use the following notation:

$$\Gamma \vdash e : T \dashv \Gamma'$$

where:
- $\Gamma$ (input context): The typing context before evaluating $e$, containing bindings and their states.
- $\vdash$ (turnstile): Separates the context from the judgment; read as "entails" or "proves."
- $e : T$: The expression $e$ has type $T$.
- $\dashv$ (reverse turnstile): Separates the judgment from the output context; indicates "producing."
- $\Gamma'$ (output context): The typing context after evaluating $e$, reflecting any state changes (e.g., moved bindings).

When only the input context matters (no state change), the simpler form $\Gamma \vdash e : T$ is used.

#### 1.7.5 Inference Rule Format

**Inference rules** are written as:

$$\frac{\text{premise}_1 \quad \text{premise}_2 \quad \ldots}{\text{conclusion}}$$

The rule states: if all premises above the line hold, then the conclusion below the line holds. Rules are labeled with names in parentheses, e.g., `(T-Var)`, for cross-reference.

#### 1.7.6 Auxiliary Notation

In addition to the EBNF productions, the specification uses a small amount of auxiliary notation for brevity:

##### Conventions
- **Metavariables.** Italic identifiers (e.g., *x*, *t*, *e*) range over syntactic classes defined by the grammar.

##### Other
- **Sequences.** A superscript "*" (e.g., *A*\*) denotes a finite (possibly empty) sequence of *A*; concatenation of sequences is written by juxtaposition.
- **Optionality.** A superscript "?" (e.g., *A*?) denotes an optional occurrence.
- **Records and field selection.** Records are written using `{ field = value, ... }`; field selection uses dot notation (`r.field`).
- **Substitution / updating.** Replacing a component of a structure is written as an update on the original value (e.g., `r[field = v]`), when needed for declarative rules.

Note

This notation is descriptive, not algorithmic: rules state constraints and outcomes, not an implementation strategy.

#### 1.7.7 Lists

Unless a rule states otherwise:

- Lists and sequences are **finite**.
- List indices are **0-based**.
- A rule that "selects the *i*-th element" is only applicable when the index is in range; otherwise the phrase is invalid (Static Semantics) or traps (Dynamic Semantics), as specified at the use site.

### 1.8 Terms and Definitions

The following terms have precise meanings in this specification:

**Binding.** An association between an identifier and a value, created by `let` or `var` declarations, procedure parameters, or pattern matching. See §3.3.

**Capability.** A first-class value representing unforgeable authority to perform a specific class of external effects. Capabilities are passed explicitly as parameters. See §4.

**Expression.** A syntactic construct that, when evaluated, produces a value and possibly side effects. See §15.

**Lexeme.** The character sequence matched by a lexical production during tokenization. A lexeme is the concrete syntactic representation of a token in source text.

**Linear.** (lattice theory) A lattice in which every pair of elements is comparable; also called "totally ordered." A linear lattice has exactly one path between top and bottom.

**Nominal Equivalence.** Two types are nominally equivalent if and only if they refer to the same declaration. Records and enums use nominal equivalence.

**Payload.** Associated data carried by an enum variant or union member. A variant may have no payload (unit-like), a tuple payload (positional fields), or a record payload (named fields).

**Permission.** One of `const`, `unique`, or `shared`, specifying the access rights for a binding or reference. See §10.

**Place Expression.** An expression that denotes a memory location (also known as an l-value). Place expressions include:
- Identifiers bound to variables (`x`)
- Field access (`x.field`)
- Indexed access (`x[i]`)
- Dereference (`*ptr`)

Place expressions may appear on the left-hand side of assignments and as operands of address-of (`&`) and move expressions.

**Responsibility.** The obligation to invoke `Drop::drop` on an object when its lifetime ends. Exactly one binding holds responsibility for each object. See §3.4.

**Statement.** A syntactic construct that, when executed, performs an action and does not produce a value. See §16.

**Structural Equivalence.** Two types are structurally equivalent if their component types are equivalent and in the same order. Tuples, arrays, slices, and union types use structural equivalence.

### 1.9 Implementation Limits

#### 1.9.1 Minimum Guaranteed Limits

**Implementation limits** are minimum guaranteed capacities that all conforming implementations MUST support. Programs exceeding these limits are ill-formed.

| Limit             | Value        |
| :---------------- | :----------- |
| Source Size       | 1 MiB        |
| Logical Lines     | 65,535       |
| Line Length       | 16,384 chars |
| Nesting Depth     | 256          |
| Identifier Length | 1,023 chars  |
| Parameters        | 255          |
| Fields            | 1,024        |

**Diagnostics:** See Appendix A, code `E-CNF-0301`.

#### 1.9.2 Compile-Time Execution Limits

**Comptime limits** are minimum guaranteed capacities for `comptime` evaluation (see §20.1).

| Limit                      | Value              |
| :------------------------- | :----------------- |
| Comptime Recursion Depth   | 256 frames         |
| Comptime Evaluation Steps  | 10,000,000         |
| Comptime Memory Allocation | 256 MiB            |
| Comptime String Length     | 16 MiB             |
| Comptime Sequence Length   | 1,000,000 elements |
| Total Emitted Declarations | 100,000            |

### 1.10 Behavior Classifications

All well-formed program behaviors partition into four mutually exclusive categories based on how this specification constrains outcomes and what guarantees implementations provide. Ill-formed programs are classified separately as IFNDR (§1.10.5).

#### 1.10.1 Defined Behavior

**Defined Behavior** is program behavior for which this specification prescribes exactly one permitted outcome. Conforming implementations MUST produce the defined outcome for all well-formed programs exercising such behavior.

#### 1.10.2 Implementation-Defined Behavior (IDB)

**Implementation-Defined Behavior (IDB)** is behavior where this specification permits multiple valid outcomes and requires the implementation to document which outcome it chooses. The implementation MUST:

1. Select exactly one outcome from the permitted set.
2. Maintain consistency across all compilations with the same configuration.

Implementations MUST document the selected outcome for each instance of Implementation-Defined Behavior. This documentation MUST be publicly available and MUST be consistent across all programs compiled under the same implementation version and target configuration.

Programs relying on a specific IDB choice are conforming but non-portable.

#### 1.10.3 Unspecified Behavior (USB)

**Unspecified Behavior (USB)** is behavior where this specification permits a set of valid outcomes but does not require the implementation to document which outcome is chosen. The choice MAY vary between executions, compilations, or within a single execution. USB in safe code MUST NOT introduce memory unsafety or data races.

#### 1.10.4 Unverifiable Behavior (UVB)

**Unverifiable Behavior (UVB)** refers to operations whose runtime correctness depends on properties external to the language's semantic model. UVB is permitted only within `unsafe` blocks and FFI calls. An `unsafe` block assertion transfers responsibility for maintaining external invariants to the programmer.

**Safety Invariant.** Safe code cannot exhibit Unverifiable Behavior. For any well-formed program where all expressions are outside of `unsafe` blocks, the program MUST NOT exhibit any Unverifiable Behavior. This invariant is enforced by the type system (§9) and the permission system (§10).

#### 1.10.5 Ill-Formed, No Diagnostic Required (IFNDR)

**Ill-Formed, No Diagnostic Required (IFNDR)** applies when a program violates a static-semantic rule and detecting such a violation is computationally undecidable or infeasible. An implementation is not required to issue a diagnostic in such cases.

**Classification Criteria.** A violation is classified as IFNDR when at least one of the following conditions holds:

1. The violation involves a property that is undecidable in general (e.g., halting, unbounded symbolic execution).
2. The violation requires analysis that exceeds polynomial complexity in the size of the program.
3. The violation depends on runtime values that cannot be statically determined.

**IFNDR Categories:**
##### Other
- **OOB in Const Eval**: Index out of bounds during constant evaluation where index is not a static constant.
- **Recursion Limits**: Exceeding implementation limits in complex metaprogramming that cannot be bounded.
- **Infinite Type**: Type definitions that would require infinite expansion.
- **Unbounded Unrolling**: Loop unrolling in `comptime` context that cannot be statically bounded.

**Safety Boundary.** The observable effects of executing an IFNDR program are Unspecified Behavior (USB). The Safety Invariant (§1.10.4) still applies: when the IFNDR condition occurs in safe code, the observable effects MUST NOT exhibit Unverifiable Behavior (UVB).

*Permitted outcomes:*
- Compilation failure (if detected)
- Deterministic panic at runtime
- Non-deterministic but safe execution

*Prohibited outcomes:*
- Memory corruption
- Data races
- Arbitrary code execution

## 2. Structure
### 2.1 Modules and Compilation

Modules and compilation define how source files are grouped into projects, assemblies, modules, and compilation units, and how module identities are derived from filesystem structure.

#### 2.1.1 Compilation Units and Projects

This section defines the organizational units used by the compiler and the filesystem structure that determines module identity.

##### 2.1.1.1 Project Definition

**Project.** The top-level organizational unit consisting of a collection of source files and a single manifest file (`Cursive.toml`) at its root. A project defines one or more assemblies.

##### 2.1.1.2 Assembly Definition

**Assembly.** A collection of modules compiled and distributed as a single unit. An assembly MAY be either a `library` or an `executable`. Each assembly is defined within the project manifest.

##### 2.1.1.3 Module Definition

**Module.** The fundamental unit of code organization and encapsulation. A module's contents are defined by the `.cursive` source files within a single directory. Its namespace is identified by a unique, filesystem-derived module path.

**Syntax**

```ebnf
top_level_item ::= import_decl
                 | use_decl
                 | static_decl
                 | procedure_decl
                 | record_decl
                 | enum_decl
                 | modal_decl
                 | type_alias_decl
                 | class_declaration

static_decl    ::= visibility? ("let" | "var") binding_decl
```

**Static Semantics**

**Module Well-Formedness**

A module is well-formed if:
1. All top-level declarations are valid according to the grammar.
2. Each identifier is unique within the module's namespace.
3. No control-flow constructs (`if`, `loop`, `match`) appear at top level.
4. No expression statements appear at top level.

**Visibility Default**

Top-level items without an explicit visibility modifier default to `internal`.

**Identifier Uniqueness**

Each identifier MUST be unique within module scope. Because Cursive uses a unified namespace (§2.2), a type declaration and a term declaration MUST NOT share the same identifier.

**Diagnostics:** See Appendix A, codes `E-MOD-1106`, `E-MOD-1302`, `E-SRC-0501`.

##### 2.1.1.4 Compilation Unit

**Compilation Unit.** The set of all source files constituting a single module. Each compilation unit defines exactly one module. An empty module (containing only whitespace and comments) is valid.

#### 2.1.2 Module Paths and Discovery

Module paths provide a filesystem-derived identifier for each module within an assembly.

##### 2.1.2.1 Module Path Definition

**Module Path.** A sequence of identifiers separated by `::` that uniquely identifies a module within an assembly. Module paths are derived from filesystem structure.

**Syntax**

```ebnf
module_path ::= identifier ("::" identifier)*
```

**Static Semantics**

**Module Path Derivation**

The module path for a given module MUST be derived from its directory path relative to the assembly's source root directory. Directory separators in the path MUST be replaced by the scope resolution operator `::`.

**(WF-Module-Path-Derivation)**

$$
\frac{P \vdash \text{assembly} \Rightarrow (\text{root\_path}, \_) \quad \text{dir\_path} = \text{absolute}(\text{module\_dir}) \quad \text{rel\_path} = \text{relative}(\text{dir\_path}, \text{root\_path})}{P \vdash \text{dir\_path} \Rightarrow \text{replace}(\text{rel\_path}, \text{PATH\_SEPARATOR}, "::")}
$$

##### 2.1.2.2 Path Component Static Semantics

**Static Semantics**

**(WF-Module-Path)**

$$
\frac{
    \forall c \in \text{components}(p), (\vdash c : \text{Identifier} \land \vdash c : \text{NotKeyword})
}{
    \vdash p : WF_{path}
}
$$

A module path is well-formed if and only if every component is a valid Cursive identifier (§7.1.5) and is not a reserved keyword (§7.1.5.2).

**Case-Sensitivity Collision Detection**

On filesystems that are not case-sensitive, two file or directory names that differ only in case MUST be treated as ambiguous if they would resolve to the same module path component.

Let $N(p)$ be the NFC-normalized, case-folded version of a path component $p$:

**(WF-Module-Path-Collision)**

$$
\frac{
    \exists p_1, p_2 \in \text{project\_paths} \quad p_1 \neq p_2 \quad N(p_1) = N(p_2)
}{
    \text{Collision Error}
}
$$

**Diagnostics:** See Appendix A, codes `E-MOD-1104`, `E-MOD-1105`, `W-MOD-1101`. For `E-MOD-1106` (invalid identifier in module path), see §2.1.1.3.

#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   Cursive MUST be implemented with a single, **unified namespace** per scope. An identifier's meaning is determined only by its spelling and the scope in which it is defined, not by the syntactic context of its use.
-   This single namespace MUST be shared by all declaration kinds:
-   A declaration that introduces an identifier into the current scope MUST be well-formed only if that identifier is not already bound in the same scope.
-   A declaration in an inner scope MAY shadow a name from an outer scope:
-   The `protected` modifier MUST NOT be used on top-level (module-scope) declarations. It MUST only be applied to members (fields or procedures) within a `record`, `enum`, or `modal` declaration.
-   For modules in **external assemblies**, an `import` declaration MUST precede any `use` declaration that references items from that assembly.
-   For modules in the **same assembly** (intra-assembly access), `use` declarations MAY directly reference module paths without a preceding `import`.
-   Resolves each item in the list and introduces bindings for all of them. Each item in the list MUST be unique.
-   3. The source item MUST itself be `public`; re-exporting `internal` or `private` items is forbidden
-   Names introduced by `import as` or `use` declarations MUST NOT conflict with existing names in the same scope.

#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   An attribute list MUST appear immediately before the declaration or expression it modifies. Multiple attributes MAY be specified in a single block or in separate blocks; the forms are semantically equivalent.
-   1. The implementation MUST verify $A.\text{Name} \in \mathcal{R}$
-   2. The implementation MUST verify $D$ is a valid target for $A$
-   3. The implementation MUST verify $A.\text{Args}$ conforms to the argument specification
-   1. Vendor attributes MUST use reverse-domain-style prefixes: `[[com.vendor.attribute_name]]`
-   An implementation encountering an unknown attribute (not in $\mathcal{R}$) MUST diagnose error `E-MOD-2451`.
-   1. Fields MUST be laid out in declaration order
-   2. Padding MUST be inserted only as required by the target platform's C ABI
-   3. Total size MUST be a multiple of the record's alignment
-   1. The discriminant MUST be represented as a C-compatible integer tag
-   3. Layout MUST conform to tagged union per target C ABI
-   1. The discriminant MUST use the specified integer type
-   2. Each variant's discriminant value MUST be representable in that type
-   2. Each field MUST be laid out with alignment 1
-   Taking a reference to a packed field is Unverifiable Behavior (UVB); such operations MUST occur within an `unsafe` block.
-   1. $N$ MUST be a positive integer that is a power of two
-   The implementation SHOULD inline the procedure at call sites when feasible. No diagnostic is required if inlining is not performed.
-   The implementation SHOULD inline the procedure at all call sites. If inlining is not possible (recursive, exceeds limits, address taken), warning `W-MOD-2452` MUST be emitted.
-   The implementation MAY inline at its discretion.
-   The implementation MUST NOT inline the procedure. The procedure body MUST be emitted as a separate callable unit; all calls MUST use the standard calling convention.
-   The attribute takes no arguments and is valid only on procedure declarations. It is a hint; implementations MAY ignore it.
-   1. The implementation MUST emit warning `W-CNF-0601` (per §1.5)
-   2. If a message argument is present, the diagnostic SHOULD include it
-   Within a `[[dynamic]]` scope, if static key safety analysis fails, runtime synchronization MAY be inserted.
-   3. When present, the implementation MUST NOT emit `W-CON-0011` for uses of that binding.
-   3. The symbol name MUST be a valid identifier for the target platform's linker
-   4. MUST NOT be combined with `[[symbol]]` on the same declaration

-   An implementation MUST reject any assignment or argument where the source type is not a subtype of the target type.
-   An implementation MUST reject a subtyping judgment that violates variance rules.
-   When a type parameter has invariant variance, the implementation MUST require exact type equivalence for that parameter in subtyping checks.

- **Normative syntax code blocks (non-EBNF) present in this section’s Syntax subsection:** [TODO: None detected.]

##### Conventions
- **Defined terms (bold-term prose items):** `Variance`

##### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   An implementation MUST reject a subtyping judgment that violates variance rules.
-   When a type parameter has invariant variance, the implementation MUST require exact type equivalence for that parameter in subtyping checks.

##### Conventions
- **Defined terms (bold-term prose items):** `Type Inference`, `Local Type Inference`

##### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   Type inference MUST be local: inference operates within a single procedure body and MUST NOT propagate type information across procedure boundaries.
-   An implementation MUST NOT infer types for public API boundaries.
-   The following positions MUST have explicit type annotations:
-   The following positions MAY omit type annotations when the type is inferable:
-   An implementation MUST reject a program if inference fails to derive a unique type for any expression.

#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   Division (`/`) and remainder (`%`) operations MUST panic when the divisor is zero.
-   Floating-point arithmetic MUST conform to IEEE 754-2008 for the corresponding precision (`f16`/binary16, `f32`/binary32, `f64`/binary64), including NaN, infinities, signed zero, and division-by-zero semantics.
-   A valid `bool` value MUST be represented by exactly `0x00` or `0x01`. Any other bit pattern is invalid; constructing such a value is UVB.
-   **Array.** A contiguous, fixed-length, homogeneous sequence of elements. The length is part of the type and MUST be known at compile time.
-   All array indexing is bounds-checked at runtime. Access with index $i \geq N$ MUST panic.
-   Implementations MUST NOT insert padding between array elements.
-   - `start` MUST satisfy $0 \leq \text{start} \leq L$
-   - `end` MUST satisfy $\text{start} \leq \text{end} \leq L$
-   Violation MUST cause panic.
-   Default field visibility is `private`. Field visibility MUST NOT exceed record visibility.
-   The source expression type MUST equal the constructed record type. The type path $R$ in the construction MUST match the type of $e_{\text{src}}$.
-   - If $T_f$ does not implement `Copy`: the source expression MUST be a move expression (`move` applied to a place expression).
-   Fields copied implicitly via record update MUST be visible in the current scope. Private fields not visible at the update site prevent the update.
-   Discriminant values MUST be unique within an enum. The discriminant type is IDB.
-   **Enum Pattern Matching.** Accessing enum variant data MUST be performed using a `match` expression. Direct field access is forbidden.
-   A `match` expression on an enum MUST be exhaustive. See §15.8.4 for exhaustiveness requirements.
-   Implementations MUST apply niche optimization when variant payloads contain invalid bit patterns that can encode the discriminant.
-   Niche optimization MUST be applied to union types.

-   Discriminant values MUST be unique within an enum. The discriminant type is IDB.
-   **Enum Pattern Matching.** Accessing enum variant data MUST be performed using a `match` expression. Direct field access is forbidden.
-   A `match` expression on an enum MUST be exhaustive. See §15.8.4 for exhaustiveness requirements.

-   Niche optimization (see §11.7) MUST be applied to modal types.
-   1. A `modal` declaration MUST contain at least one state block.
-   2. All state names within a single `modal` declaration MUST be unique.
-   3. State names MUST NOT collide with the modal type name itself.
-   External code MUST NOT directly access payload fields.
-   where $P_{\text{src}}$ MUST be `unique` for consuming transitions.
-   Methods and transitions MUST be defined inline within their state block.
-   The match MUST be exhaustive: all declared states MUST be covered.
-   1. `string@Managed` MUST NOT implement `Copy` (owns heap allocation)
-   2. `string@Managed` MUST NOT implement `Clone` (use `clone_with(heap)`)
-   3. `string@Managed` MUST implement `Drop` (deallocates buffer)
-   4. `string@View` MUST implement `Copy` (non-owning pointer-length pair)
-   `string@Managed` values capture allocator metadata derived from the `$HeapAllocator` used at construction time. This metadata is used by `Drop::drop` to deallocate the buffer. All operations that allocate or resize MUST still receive an explicit `$HeapAllocator` capability parameter. Implementations MAY store allocator metadata out‑of‑line. The metadata is not observable by programs and does not affect the fixed three‑word layout shown below.
-   Operations requiring allocation MUST receive a `$HeapAllocator` capability:
-   1. `Ptr<T>@State` MUST NOT appear in `extern` procedure signatures
-   2. FFI boundary procedures MUST use raw pointer types
-   1. Closure types MUST NOT appear in `extern` signatures
-   3. Sparse function pointers in FFI MUST NOT have generic type parameters
-   1. Argument count MUST equal parameter count
-   2. Each argument type MUST be a subtype of corresponding parameter type
-   3. For `move` parameters, argument MUST be explicit `move` expression

#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   When type arguments are not explicitly provided, the implementation MUST infer them using bidirectional type inference (§9.4). Inference sources:
-   Generic procedures in classes cannot participate in dynamic dispatch. Such procedures MUST be marked with `[[static_dispatch_only]]` (§7.4) and can only be called through concrete type references, not through `$Class` references.
-   1. A class bound MUST reference a valid class type; bounding by non-class types is forbidden.
-   2. A generic instantiation MUST provide exactly the number of type arguments declared.
-   3. Type arguments MUST satisfy all constraints declared for their corresponding parameters.
-   2. **Zero Overhead:** Calls to generic procedures MUST compile to direct static calls to the specialized instantiation. Virtual dispatch is prohibited for static polymorphism.
-   Monomorphization MAY produce recursive instantiations. Implementations MUST detect and reject infinite monomorphization recursion. The maximum instantiation depth is IDB; minimum supported depth is 128.
-   **Abstract Procedure.** A procedure signature within a class that lacks a body. Implementing types MUST provide a concrete implementation.
-   **Concrete Procedure.** A procedure definition within a class that includes a body. Implementing types automatically inherit this procedure but MAY override it using the `override` keyword.
-   - If abstract (no `= T`): implementing types MUST provide a concrete type binding
-   - If concrete (`= T`): provides a default type that MAY be overridden
-   Class implementation MUST occur at the type's definition site. Extension implementations are prohibited.
-   - **Implementing an abstract procedure**: `override` keyword MUST NOT be used
-   - **Overriding a concrete procedure**: `override` keyword MUST be used
-   A type `T` MAY implement a class `Cl` at most once.
-   For `T <: Cl`, at least one of `T` or `Cl` MUST be defined in the current assembly.
-   **Multiple Constraints.** A type parameter MAY have multiple class bounds using the `+` separator or comma-separated bounds after `<:`.
-   **Where Clauses.** As an alternative to inline bounds, constraints MAY be specified in a `where` clause. See §13.1.3 for full grammar.
-   Opaque types MUST incur zero runtime overhead. The returned value is the concrete type, not a dense pointer. Type encapsulation is enforced statically.
-   Implementations MUST support:
-   - `Drop::drop` MUST NOT be called directly by user code (`E-MEM-3005`, §3.5.3).
-   - Any type implementing `Copy` MUST also implement `Clone`.
-   Types implementing `Hash` MUST also implement `Eq`. If two values are equal per `Eq::eq`, they MUST produce the same hash value.

#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   When an argument with `unique` permission is passed to a non‑`move` parameter, the caller’s `unique` path becomes **Inactive** for the dynamic extent of the call. While the caller’s path is inactive, the caller MUST NOT read, write, or move that storage; on return, the caller’s path reactivates. Any read, write, or move through an inactive `unique` binding is ill‑formed per the exclusivity invariant (§10.1.2) and the unique downgrade state machine (§10.2.2).
-   Within a method body, `self` refers to the receiver instance. The `self` binding is introduced implicitly by the receiver declaration, has the type and permission specified by the receiver, and MUST NOT be explicitly declared in the parameter list.
-   A contract clause (`|=`) MUST appear after the return type annotation (or after the parameter list if no return type) and before the procedure body.
-   **Pure Expression.** An expression whose evaluation produces no observable side effects. All expressions within a contract MUST be pure.
-   1. $e$ MUST NOT invoke any procedure that accepts capability parameters
-   2. $e$ MUST NOT mutate state observable outside the expression's evaluation
-   MUST NOT include:
-   **Precondition.** The logical expression appearing to the left of `=>` in a `|=` contract clause, or the entire expression if `=>` is absent. The caller MUST ensure this expression evaluates to `true` prior to the call.
-   Failure to satisfy a precondition is diagnosed at the **caller**. The diagnostic MUST identify the call site.
-   **Postcondition.** The logical expression appearing to the right of `=>` in a `|=` contract clause. The callee MUST ensure this expression evaluates to `true` immediately before returning.
-   Failure to satisfy a postcondition is diagnosed at the **callee**. The diagnostic MUST identify the return point.
-   | Expression Constraint | `expr` MUST be pure                                    |
-   | Expression Scope      | `expr` MUST reference only parameters and receiver     |
-   | Type Constraint       | Result type of `expr` MUST implement `Copy` or `Clone` |
-   Types with type invariants MUST NOT declare public mutable fields.
-   Private procedures (`internal` or less) are exempt from the Pre-Call enforcement point. The type invariant MUST be verified when a private procedure returns to a public caller.
-   **Loop Invariant.** A `where` clause attached to a `loop` expression. The invariant specifies a predicate that MUST hold at the beginning of every iteration and after termination.
-   1. The runtime MUST trigger a Panic
-   2. The panic payload MUST include predicate text, source location, and contract type
-   - MUST NOT be stored in variables, passed as parameters, or returned
-   **Liskov Substitution.** When a type implements a class, procedure implementations MUST adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle with respect to class-defined contracts.
-   An implementation MAY weaken (require less than) the preconditions defined in the class. An implementation MUST NOT strengthen (require more than) the preconditions.
-   An implementation MAY strengthen (guarantee more than) the postconditions defined in the class. An implementation MUST NOT weaken (guarantee less than) the postconditions.

#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   For any compound expression, subexpressions MUST be evaluated strictly left-to-right. Given expression $e = f(e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n)$:
-   Side effects of $e_i$ MUST be observable before evaluation of $e_{i+1}$ begins. No reordering of observable effects is permitted.
-   The identifier MUST resolve to a value binding per §6.2. If it resolves to a type, module, or class, the program is ill-formed.
-   Path expressions resolve through the module hierarchy per §6.2. The final component MUST be a value (constant, procedure, or enum variant constructor).
-   The index expression MUST have type `usize`. No implicit integer conversions are performed.
-   All indexing operations MUST be bounds-checked at runtime. If $\text{index} \ge \text{length}$, the executing thread MUST panic.
-   1. The number of arguments MUST equal the number of parameters
-   2. Each argument type MUST be compatible with the parameter type per §9.2
-   3. If a parameter has the `move` modifier, the corresponding argument MUST be a move expression (`move` applied to a place expression)
-   4. The receiver type MUST match the method's `self` parameter type exactly
-   **Integer Overflow**: Arithmetic operations MUST panic on overflow in debug mode. Release mode behavior is Implementation-Defined per §11.1.
-   **Division by Zero**: MUST panic.
-   A binding with `unique` permission MUST be captured via explicit `move`.
-   Matches if `scrutinee == literal`. The literal type MUST be compatible with the scrutinee type.
-   Both `start` and `end` MUST be compile-time constant expressions.
-   1. Guard MUST have type `bool`
-   4. Guard MAY reference pattern bindings
-   **Exhaustiveness.** A `match` expression MUST be exhaustive: the set of patterns MUST cover every possible value of the scrutinee type.
-   - `enum` types: All variants MUST be covered
-   - `modal` types: All states MUST be covered
-   - `bool` type: Both `true` and `false` MUST be covered
-   - Integer types with range patterns: Union of ranges MUST cover all values, OR wildcard present
-   Labels are visible within the labeled loop's body. Nested loops MAY reference outer labels.
-   1. `break` MUST appear within a `loop` body
-   4. All `break` statements for same loop MUST provide compatible types
-   1. `continue` MUST appear within a `loop` body

#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   **Read Mode.** A key mode that permits read-only access to a path. Multiple Read keys to overlapping paths MAY coexist.
-   Implementations MUST guarantee eventual progress: any task blocked waiting for a key MUST eventually acquire that key, provided the holder eventually releases it.
-   Implementations MUST ensure:
-   An escaping closure that captures `shared` bindings MUST carry a shared dependency set in its closure type (§12.4.3):
-   The dependency set MAY be inferred when the closure is assigned to a binding with an expected closure type; otherwise it MUST be written explicitly.
-   An escaping closure MUST NOT outlive any captured `shared` binding. Implementations MUST reject any flow where the closure’s lifetime exceeds the lifetime of a captured `shared` root.
-   **Static Conflict Analysis.** When multiple dynamic indices access the same array within a single statement, they MUST be provably disjoint; otherwise, the program is ill-formed.
-   Between steps 1 and 2 (entry), and between steps 4 and 5 (exit), other tasks MAY acquire keys to the same path.
-   The snapshot step (2) MUST be observationally equivalent to an atomic snapshot over the keyed set. The commit step (4) MUST be atomic with respect to all other key operations on overlapping paths and MUST satisfy the `SpeculativeCommit` predicate above. The concrete mechanisms used to realize these properties are Implementation‑Defined (IDB).
-   Memory ordering annotations MUST NOT appear inside speculative blocks (§17.5).

#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   The runtime provides a CPU execution domain via `ctx.cpu(...)`. This constructor, its parameters, and helper types (e.g., `CpuSet`, `Priority`) are core‑library/runtime interfaces and are not normative in this document. Any value produced by `ctx.cpu(...)` MUST implement `ExecutionDomain`.
-   **Unique Capture.** Bindings with `unique` permission MUST NOT be implicitly captured. To use a `unique` binding in a work item, explicit `move` is required. Only one work item may receive ownership.
-   `SpawnHandle<T>` supports the `wait` expression for result retrieval. Per §17, keys MUST NOT be held across `wait` suspension points.
-   Reduction operators MUST be associative:
-   **Cancellation.** The cooperative mechanism by which in-progress parallel work may be requested to stop early. Work items MUST explicitly check for cancellation; the runtime does not forcibly terminate work.
-   | Work is queued but not started | MAY be dequeued without executing |
-   4. Other panics are discarded; implementations MAY log them.
-   Implementations MAY request cancellation on first panic to expedite block completion. This behavior is Implementation-Defined.
-   The `[ordered]` attribute forces sequential side-effect ordering. Iterations MAY execute in parallel, but side effects (I/O, shared mutation) are buffered and applied in index order.
-   1. GPU parallel blocks MUST NOT be nested inside other GPU parallel blocks.

#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   The body of a comptime block or expression MUST satisfy all comptime restrictions (§20.1).
-   1. All parameter types MUST be comptime-available.
-   2. The return type MUST be comptime-available.
-   3. The procedure body MUST satisfy comptime restrictions.
-   4. If a `requires` clause is present, all predicates MUST evaluate to `true` at each call site.
-   A conforming implementation MUST enforce the following minimum guaranteed capacities:
-   Implementations MAY support higher limits. The actual limits are implementation-defined.
-   1. Paths MUST be relative to the project root directory.
-   2. Paths MUST NOT contain `..` components traversing above project root.
-   3. Paths MUST NOT follow symbolic links escaping the project directory.
-   Quoted content MUST be syntactically valid. Type checking of quoted content is deferred until emission (§20.4.5).
-   After the Metaprogramming Phase completes, the implementation MUST perform full type checking on the expanded AST. Type errors in emitted code MUST be reported with a diagnostic trace including:
-   A derive attribute MUST immediately precede a type declaration (`record`, `enum`, or `modal`).
-   Each identifier in the derive target list MUST resolve to a derive target declaration (§20.5.2) or a standard derive target (§20.5.4).
-   For each `emits F` clause, the derive target MUST emit an AST node that, when type-checked, results in the target type implementing class $F$:
-   For each `requires F` clause, the target type MUST implement class $F$ before derive target execution:
-   All fields MUST implement the corresponding class being derived.

- **Static Semantics inference rules (labeled):** [TODO: None detected.]
- **Other math formalisms in Static Semantics:**
-   $$\mathcal{R} = \mathcal{R}_{\text{spec}} \uplus \mathcal{R}_{\text{vendor}}$$
- **Normative requirement lines within Static Semantics (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   An attribute list MUST appear immediately before the declaration or expression it modifies. Multiple attributes MAY be specified in a single block or in separate blocks; the forms are semantically equivalent.
-   1. The implementation MUST verify $A.\text{Name} \in \mathcal{R}$
-   2. The implementation MUST verify $D$ is a valid target for $A$
-   3. The implementation MUST verify $A.\text{Args}$ conforms to the argument specification
-   1. Vendor attributes MUST use reverse-domain-style prefixes: `[[com.vendor.attribute_name]]`
-   An implementation encountering an unknown attribute (not in $\mathcal{R}$) MUST diagnose error `E-MOD-2451`.
-   1. Fields MUST be laid out in declaration order
-   2. Padding MUST be inserted only as required by the target platform's C ABI
-   3. Total size MUST be a multiple of the record's alignment
-   1. The discriminant MUST be represented as a C-compatible integer tag
-   3. Layout MUST conform to tagged union per target C ABI
-   1. The discriminant MUST use the specified integer type
-   2. Each variant's discriminant value MUST be representable in that type
-   2. Each field MUST be laid out with alignment 1
-   Taking a reference to a packed field is Unverifiable Behavior (UVB); such operations MUST occur within an `unsafe` block.
-   1. $N$ MUST be a positive integer that is a power of two
-   The implementation SHOULD inline the procedure at call sites when feasible. No diagnostic is required if inlining is not performed.
-   The implementation SHOULD inline the procedure at all call sites. If inlining is not possible (recursive, exceeds limits, address taken), warning `W-MOD-2452` MUST be emitted.
-   The implementation MAY inline at its discretion.
-   The implementation MUST NOT inline the procedure. The procedure body MUST be emitted as a separate callable unit; all calls MUST use the standard calling convention.
-   The attribute takes no arguments and is valid only on procedure declarations. It is a hint; implementations MAY ignore it.
-   1. The implementation MUST emit warning `W-CNF-0601` (per §1.5)
-   2. If a message argument is present, the diagnostic SHOULD include it

##### Static Semantics
- **Static Semantics inference rules (labeled):** [TODO: None detected.]

-   3. `string@Managed` MUST implement `Drop` (deallocates buffer)
-   4. `string@View` MUST implement `Copy` (non-owning pointer-length pair)
-   `string@Managed` values capture allocator metadata derived from the `$HeapAllocator` used at construction time. This metadata is used by `Drop::drop` to deallocate the buffer. All operations that allocate or resize MUST still receive an explicit `$HeapAllocator` capability parameter. Implementations MAY store allocator metadata out‑of‑line. The metadata is not observable by programs and does not affect the fixed three‑word layout shown below.

- **Static Semantics inference rules (labeled):** [TODO: None detected.]
- **Math formalisms:** [TODO: None detected.]
- **Normative requirement lines within Static Semantics (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   1. `Region` values MUST NOT implement `Copy`.
-   3. `free_unchecked` MUST be invoked exactly once on any `Region` that remains in `@Active` or `@Frozen` at scope exit. Implementations MAY invoke `free_unchecked` implicitly during region block cleanup (§16.7.4).
-   4. After `reset_unchecked` or `free_unchecked`, all values and pointers with provenance $\pi_{\text{Region}}(r)$ derived from that arena become invalid. Accessing such values constitutes Unverifiable Behavior (UVB). Programs SHOULD explicitly drop any live region‑provenanced bindings before invoking these operations.

#### 5.2.6 The Abstract Machine and Observable Behavior
##### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines within Execution (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   **Observable Behavior.** The externally detectable effect of program execution. The compiler MUST preserve observable behavior; all other aspects of execution are subject to transformation.
-   `Drop::drop` invocations are observable and MUST occur in LIFO order (§3.5.2):
-   3. A program that panics MUST NOT exhibit behavior as if it had not panicked
-   **As-If Rule.** An implementation MAY perform any transformation of a Cursive program that does not change observable behavior.

##### Dynamic Semantics
- **Execution inference rules (labeled):** `(AM-Expr)`, `(AM-Stmt)`, `(AM-Key-Acquire)`, `(AM-Drop)`

-   $$\frac{ \text{Permission}(P) = \texttt{shared} \quad \neg\text{Covered}(P, M, \mathcal{K}) }{ \mathcal{K}' = \mathcal{K} \cup \{(P, M, S)\} }$$
-   $$\frac{ \text{Responsible}(b) \quad \text{ScopeExit}(b) }{ \text{invoke } \texttt{Drop::drop}(b) \text{ then release storage} }$$

### 5.7 Program Lifecycle
#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines within Execution (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   Before the program's `main` procedure is invoked, the runtime MUST:
-   Within a module, initializers MUST execute in strictly sequential lexical order within each source file. When a module comprises multiple source files, the order in which files are processed is Implementation-Defined Behavior (IDB) consistent with §5.1.5.
-   3. Any subsequent attempt to access a binding from that module, or from any module with an eager dependency path to it, MUST also result in a panic
-   Exactly one `main` procedure MUST exist in the entry assembly.
-   Module-level `var` bindings MUST NOT have `public` visibility. This prohibition ensures capability-based security by preventing mutable state from being shared across module boundaries without explicit capability passing.

### 5.12 Abstraction and Polymorphism
#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines within Execution (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   **Abstract Procedure.** A procedure signature within a class that lacks a body. Implementing types MUST provide a concrete implementation.
-   **Concrete Procedure.** A procedure definition within a class that includes a body. Implementing types automatically inherit this procedure but MAY override it using the `override` keyword.
-   - If abstract (no `= T`): implementing types MUST provide a concrete type binding
-   - If concrete (`= T`): provides a default type that MAY be overridden
-   Class implementation MUST occur at the type's definition site. Extension implementations are prohibited.
-   - **Implementing an abstract procedure**: `override` keyword MUST NOT be used
-   - **Overriding a concrete procedure**: `override` keyword MUST be used
-   A type `T` MAY implement a class `Cl` at most once.
-   For `T <: Cl`, at least one of `T` or `Cl` MUST be defined in the current assembly.
-   **Multiple Constraints.** A type parameter MAY have multiple class bounds using the `+` separator or comma-separated bounds after `<:`.
-   **Where Clauses.** As an alternative to inline bounds, constraints MAY be specified in a `where` clause. See §13.1.3 for full grammar.
-   Opaque types MUST incur zero runtime overhead. The returned value is the concrete type, not a dense pointer. Type encapsulation is enforced statically.
-   Implementations MUST support:
-   - `Drop::drop` MUST NOT be called directly by user code (`E-MEM-3005`, §3.5.3).
-   - Any type implementing `Copy` MUST also implement `Clone`.
-   Types implementing `Hash` MUST also implement `Eq`. If two values are equal per `Eq::eq`, they MUST produce the same hash value.

### 5.13 Procedures and Contracts
#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines within Execution (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   When an argument with `unique` permission is passed to a non‑`move` parameter, the caller’s `unique` path becomes **Inactive** for the dynamic extent of the call. While the caller’s path is inactive, the caller MUST NOT read, write, or move that storage; on return, the caller’s path reactivates. Any read, write, or move through an inactive `unique` binding is ill‑formed per the exclusivity invariant (§10.1.2) and the unique downgrade state machine (§10.2.2).

### 5.16 The Key System
#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines within Execution (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   Implementations MUST guarantee eventual progress: any task blocked waiting for a key MUST eventually acquire that key, provided the holder eventually releases it.
-   Implementations MUST ensure:
-   An escaping closure that captures `shared` bindings MUST carry a shared dependency set in its closure type (§12.4.3):
-   The dependency set MAY be inferred when the closure is assigned to a binding with an expected closure type; otherwise it MUST be written explicitly.
-   An escaping closure MUST NOT outlive any captured `shared` binding. Implementations MUST reject any flow where the closure’s lifetime exceeds the lifetime of a captured `shared` root.
-   **Static Conflict Analysis.** When multiple dynamic indices access the same array within a single statement, they MUST be provably disjoint; otherwise, the program is ill-formed.
-   Between steps 1 and 2 (entry), and between steps 4 and 5 (exit), other tasks MAY acquire keys to the same path.
-   The snapshot step (2) MUST be observationally equivalent to an atomic snapshot over the keyed set. The commit step (4) MUST be atomic with respect to all other key operations on overlapping paths and MUST satisfy the `SpeculativeCommit` predicate above. The concrete mechanisms used to realize these properties are Implementation‑Defined (IDB).
-   Memory ordering annotations MUST NOT appear inside speculative blocks (§17.5).

### 5.17 Structured Parallelism
#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines within Execution (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   The runtime provides a CPU execution domain via `ctx.cpu(...)`. This constructor, its parameters, and helper types (e.g., `CpuSet`, `Priority`) are core‑library/runtime interfaces and are not normative in this document. Any value produced by `ctx.cpu(...)` MUST implement `ExecutionDomain`.
-   **Unique Capture.** Bindings with `unique` permission MUST NOT be implicitly captured. To use a `unique` binding in a work item, explicit `move` is required. Only one work item may receive ownership.
-   `SpawnHandle<T>` supports the `wait` expression for result retrieval. Per §17, keys MUST NOT be held across `wait` suspension points.
-   Reduction operators MUST be associative:
-   **Cancellation.** The cooperative mechanism by which in-progress parallel work may be requested to stop early. Work items MUST explicitly check for cancellation; the runtime does not forcibly terminate work.
-   | Work is queued but not started | MAY be dequeued without executing |
-   4. Other panics are discarded; implementations MAY log them.
-   Implementations MAY request cancellation on first panic to expedite block completion. This behavior is Implementation-Defined.
-   The `[ordered]` attribute forces sequential side-effect ordering. Iterations MAY execute in parallel, but side effects (I/O, shared mutation) are buffered and applied in index order.
-   1. GPU parallel blocks MUST NOT be nested inside other GPU parallel blocks.

### 5.18 Asynchronous Operations
#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines within Execution (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   The operand MUST have type `Out`. The expression evaluates to type `In`.
-   The delegated async MUST have:
-   The operand MUST have `Out = ()` and `In = ()`.
-   At suspension, the task releases access rights. Other tasks MAY acquire keys to the same paths during the suspension period.
-   **Yield Key Prohibition.** By default, `yield` or `yield from` MUST NOT occur while keys are held.
-   A procedure returning `Async<Out, In, Result, !>` MUST NOT contain error-propagating expressions.

#### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   Cursive source input MUST be encoded as UTF-8 (RFC 3629). Invalid byte sequences are ill-formed.
-   1. If a source file begins with the UTF-8 BOM (U+FEFF) as the first decoded scalar value, the implementation MUST strip the BOM before lexical analysis.
-   3. A conforming implementation SHOULD emit a warning when a UTF-8 BOM is present at the start of a file.
-   2. For identifier lexemes and module-path components, implementations MUST normalize to Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) prior to equality comparison, hashing, or name lookup.
-   3. Normalization MUST NOT change logical line boundaries or byte offsets used for diagnostic locations.
-   **Prohibited Code Points.** Unicode code points that MUST NOT appear in source text outside of string and character literals.
-   Implementations MUST normalize line endings before tokenization:
-   Implementations MUST preserve documentation comments for extraction. Documentation comments MUST NOT appear in the token stream.
-   2. Block comments MUST nest: each `/*` increases nesting depth, each `*/` decreases it.
-   End-of-file with non-zero nesting depth is ill-formed. Characters within comments MUST NOT contribute to token formation, delimiter nesting, or statement termination.
-   1. Tokenization MUST be deterministic for a given normalized source file.
-   1. Identifiers MUST NOT contain prohibited code points (§2.1.4), surrogate code points (U+D800–U+DFFF), or non-characters.
-   2. Reserved keywords (§2.5.2) MUST NOT be treated as identifiers.
-   **Keyword.** A reserved lexeme with special meaning in the language grammar that MUST NOT be used where an identifier is expected.
-   Implementations MUST tokenize these as `<keyword>`, not `<identifier>`. Reserved keywords are unconditionally reserved in all syntactic contexts. The keyword set MUST be identical across conforming implementations for a given language version.
-   1. The `cursive.*` namespace prefix is reserved for specification-defined features. User programs and vendor extensions MUST NOT use this namespace.
-   2. The identifier prefix `gen_` is reserved for synthetic identifiers. User declarations MUST NOT define identifiers beginning with `gen_`.
-   3. Implementations MAY reserve additional identifier patterns (IDB).
-   **Universe-Protected Binding.** An identifier pre-declared in the implicit universal scope that MUST NOT be shadowed by user declarations at module scope.
-   1. Underscores in numeric literals MUST NOT appear at the beginning or end, immediately after a base prefix, adjacent to an exponent marker, or before a type suffix.
-   2. Based integer literals MUST begin with the appropriate prefix (`0x`, `0o`, `0b`) followed by at least one valid digit.
-   1. A floating-point literal MUST contain a decimal point.
-   1. A string literal MUST begin with `"` and end with a matching unescaped `"`.
-   3. The `\x` escape MUST be followed by exactly two hexadecimal digits.
-   4. The `\u{...}` escape MUST contain 1–6 hexadecimal digits representing a valid Unicode scalar value.
-   1. A character literal MUST begin with `'` and end with a matching unescaped `'`.
-   2. A character literal MUST represent exactly one Unicode scalar value.
-   3. The null literal MUST NOT be used to construct safe pointer values; use `Ptr::null()` (§12.3.3) for safe null pointers.
-   When a character from this set appears unescaped in an identifier, operator, punctuator, or adjacent to token boundaries (outside literals and comments), the implementation MUST emit a diagnostic.
-   The default mode is Implementation-Defined Behavior (IDB). Implementations MUST provide a mechanism to select either mode.
-   1. Lexically sensitive characters within string or character literals MUST NOT affect well-formedness.
-   2. Implementations MAY provide additional homoglyph detection for identifiers as a quality-of-implementation feature.
-   3. The Unicode Confusable mappings (Unicode TR39) MAY be used for detection.
-   1. Phase 1 MUST complete for all source files in a compilation unit before Phase 2 begins.
-   3. Forward references to declarations within the same compilation unit MUST be permitted.
-   2. Compile-time execution MAY generate additional declarations.

-   3. A conforming implementation SHOULD emit a warning when a UTF-8 BOM is present at the start of a file.
-   2. For identifier lexemes and module-path components, implementations MUST normalize to Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) prior to equality comparison, hashing, or name lookup.
-   3. Normalization MUST NOT change logical line boundaries or byte offsets used for diagnostic locations.
-   **Prohibited Code Points.** Unicode code points that MUST NOT appear in source text outside of string and character literals.

-   When a character from this set appears unescaped in an identifier, operator, punctuator, or adjacent to token boundaries (outside literals and comments), the implementation MUST emit a diagnostic.
-   The default mode is Implementation-Defined Behavior (IDB). Implementations MUST provide a mechanism to select either mode.
-   1. Lexically sensitive characters within string or character literals MUST NOT affect well-formedness.
-   2. Implementations MAY provide additional homoglyph detection for identifiers as a quality-of-implementation feature.
-   3. The Unicode Confusable mappings (Unicode TR39) MAY be used for detection.

##### Static Semantics
- **Normative requirement lines (RFC 2119 keywords):**
-   Types implementing `Drop` MUST NOT implement `Copy`. The `drop` procedure is invoked implicitly when a responsible binding goes out of scope; direct calls are ill-formed.
-   A type implementing `Copy` is duplicated rather than moved on assignment. All fields of a `Copy` type MUST also implement `Copy`.
-   The `next` procedure returns the next item or `()` when exhausted. The iterator MUST be accessed with `unique` permission.
-   Equality MUST be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
-   `Ordering` is an enum with variants `Less`, `Equal`, `Greater`. Ordering MUST be transitive and antisymmetric.
-   Types implementing `Hash` MUST also implement `Eq`. If `a~>eq(b)` returns `true`, then `a~>hash(h)` and `b~>hash(h)` MUST produce identical hasher states.
-   2. Low-level raw operations MUST occur only within `unsafe` blocks; dereferencing or freeing raw pointers outside `unsafe` is Unverifiable Behavior (UVB).
-   The `Context` is constructed by the runtime before `main` is invoked. Programs MUST NOT construct `Context` directly.
